Association-Rules
===================
### Building a recommendation system using an Association Rule.

Association rule mining uses machine learning model models to analyze data form patterns or co-occurrence in the datasets. The Association rule-mining is usually a data mining approach used to explore and interpret large transactional datasets to identify unique patterns and rules in the data set. 
This project use one of the association rule algorithms called Apriori Algorithm.
