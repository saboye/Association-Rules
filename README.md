Association-Rules
===================
### Building a recommendation system using an Association Rule.

Association rule mining uses machine learning model models to analyze data form patterns or co-occurrence in the datasets. The Association rule-mining is usually a data mining approach used to explore and interpret large transactional datasets to identify unique patterns and rules in the data set. 
This project use one of the association rule algorithms called Apriori Algorithm. 

Agrawal and Srikant proposed the Apriori algorithm in 1994. Apriori is designed to operate on data containing transactions (for example, collections of items bought by customers). Each transaction considers as a set of items. The Apriori algorithm identifies the given threshold C in the itemsets.
